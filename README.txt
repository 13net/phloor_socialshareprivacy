/**
 * Description
 */
This plugin enables the jquery.socialshareprivacy plugin on your Elgg site. 
 
More and more web sites use the social buttons from Facebook, Google+ or 
Twitter. However, these buttons are already loaded when accessing a page and
immediately transfer data to the operator of the network platforms -
without the user being able to do something about it. Facebook & Co can create 
complete data profiles of their users. Since this data is not compatible with 
the users notions of privacy - Heise online has designed a two-stage solution, 
which, by default, does not transmit data to third parties.

One click on one of the buttons means that the user consents to transmit data to 
the operator of the social network.
